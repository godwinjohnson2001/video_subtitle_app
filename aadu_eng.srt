1
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,833
What is your profession?

2
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,500
What is your job?

3
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,750
Sir, we…

4
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,583
Helpers.

5
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,125
Company work…

6
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,291
Helpers.

7
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,000
Did you both come together?

8
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,625
Are you here together?

9
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,791
Helpers.

10
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,375
I'm so sorry.

11
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,375
-What's your name?
-Chaminda.

12
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,833
Chaminda?

13
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,750
Chaminda.

14
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,833
Passport?

15
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,500
Brother, I can't find our names
on any of these placards.

16
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,458
Look, they're taking many people
and verifying their names and documents.

17
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,583
Passport?

18
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,958
Brother, which flight did you arrive on?

19
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,083
No.

20
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,458
-What did he ask?
-No idea.

21
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,375
-What did you say?
-"No."

22
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,625
I said, "I don't know."

23
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,916
Go and ask them
if our names are on their list.

24
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,041
Me?

25
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,708
They won't understand if I ask them.

26
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,625
Hey, they are leaving!

27
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,291
Go! Hurry up!

28
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,833
-Have you come from Bombay?
-Sri Lanka.

29
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,083
Which company are you working for?

30
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,791
They are from Sri Lanka.

31
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,291
Allah!

32
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,625
Whom do we ask now?

33
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,125
If it's an office number,
there's no way you can reach them.

34
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,083
Today is Friday,
and it's a holiday here.

35
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,208
Do you have any other phone number?

36
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,583
A residence number or pager number?

37
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,291
Due to the anxiety of boarding the plane,
I forgot to ask about all that.

38
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,291
The phone is ringing,
but no one is answering.

39
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,791
It might be an office number.

40
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,416
This is so foolish.

41
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,125
We should have asked the agent in Bombay

42
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,208
for the contact number
of the person picking us up.

43
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,875
Well, fantastic timing.

44
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,000
You don't have to worry.
The Kafeel will come.

45
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,291
You have visas, right?

46
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,458
He must be stuck in traffic
because it's a holiday.

47
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,416
Brother…

48
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,708
I think everyone who came with us
has left. I can't see anyone here.

49
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,916
Would they have left
without recognizing us?

50
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,083
Brother, it's 8:30 p.m.

51
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,041
My mother must be getting really worried.

52
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,666
Shouldn't we inform them that
we've arrived here from Bombay?

53
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,500
It's late in the night.

54
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,583
But how?

55
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,291
The evening prayer just ended.

56
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,541
Oh! There's a time zone difference
between here and India, right?

57
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,166
Did you notice how happy Shashi was
when I gave him my watch?

58
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,291
Poor fellow.

59
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,333
He has been waiting for so long
in Bombay to come to the Middle East,

60
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,625
just like us.

61
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,333
Hakim!

62
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,000
I think he's our man.

63
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,250
It seems like he's looking for someone.

64
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,458
Shall we go and ask him?

65
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,375
Go and ask him in English.

66
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,875
No, I don't think that would work.

67
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,791
He's coming here.

68
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,750
Is your name Abdullah?

69
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,750
And you?

70
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,208
What is your name?

71
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,916
Tell him that we have come here
on Sreekumar sir's visa.

72
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,875
I'm asking for your name!
Can't you hear me?

73
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,041
Where have you come from?

74
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,875
Who is your Kafeel?

75
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't you have any brains?

76
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,125
Oh, God!

77
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,041
Such a disaster!

78
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,791
What did he say?

79
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,291
All I understood was "Abdullah."

80
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,625
He was stinking, right?

81
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,458
Well, didn't you joke before

82
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,583
that attar and perfumes are made
from the sweat and urine of Arabs?

83
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,416
I wasn't joking.

84
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,333
The real Arabs are like that.

85
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,625
They bathe using water infused with attar.

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,166
This guy seems like a rugged Arab
who hasn't bathed in ages!

87
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,333
Anyway, the Kafeels are
still turning up, right?

88
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,458
What?

89
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Kafeel.

90
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,916
That's the first Arab word
I learned after coming here.

91
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,041
What does it mean?

92
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,166
It means…

93
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,625
Boss.

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,875
Our man.

95
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,208
Our employer.

96
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,291
Sponsor.

97
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,666
Kafeel!

98
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,541
I wonder where our Kafeel is.

99
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,833
Give me your passport.

100
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,250
Give me your passport, too.

101
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,166
Brother, he's our Kafeel. Let's go.

102
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,791
Come on, let's hurry!
It's already late.

103
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,750
I don't understand what
these guys are saying.

104
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,125
Don't you want to go quickly?

105
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,750
Come on! Get inside!

106
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,041
Get in the vehicle! Come on!

107
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,000
What is this?

108
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,875
-Sir…
-Get inside, quick! Come on!

109
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,833
These guys are driving me crazy.

110
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,708
Sir, may I get some water to drink?

111
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,083
What are you murmuring?

112
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,625
Water.

113
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,916
Don't you understand?

114
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,750
Go and sit at the back. Go!

115
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,083
Get into the vehicle. Come on.
Don't waste time.

116
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you doing? Not here!

117
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,416
Didn't I ask you to go there?

118
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,625
Go and sit at the back!

119
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,083
Go!

120
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,458
Brother!

121
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,416
Why is he shouting so much?

122
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,041
He wouldn't have
understood what we asked.

123
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,833
Well, we've come here as
company helpers, right?

124
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,375
And they are taking us in this vehicle?

125
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,541
Didn't you see?
Those Sri Lankans were taken in an AC bus.

126
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,666
You get in.

127
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,041
May God protect us.

128
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,291
I always wanted to come to Dubai--

129
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,416
Brother, look!

130
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,541
It's a tunnel.

131
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,125
Vehicles are passing above this tunnel.

132
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,333
Brother! It's even better
to stand and watch!

133
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,333
Come on!

134
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,291
It's really late, Hakim.

135
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,875
We haven't been able to contact
anyone back home yet.

136
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,916
Oh, I completely forgot about that!

137
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,416
We should stop somewhere
and make those calls.

138
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,333
-Kafeel!
-No!

139
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,000
Let's make those calls
once we get to our room.

140
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,375
Brother, it's already past 10:00 p.m.

141
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,958
My mother must be terrified.

142
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,916
Hey.

143
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,333
Kafeel!

144
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,166
I need to make a call home.
Could you please stop the vehicle?

145
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,916
Why are you blabbering?

146
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,541
Go! Go back!

147
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,916
The cops will catch you!

148
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can stop at a phone booth.

149
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,458
Can't you understand?
Go back and sit!

150
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,500
How do I make him understand?

151
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,083
-Brother!
-Yes!

152
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,625
Where are you taking them?

153
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,875
To the market?

154
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,833
-Wishing you well!
-Wishing you the best!

155
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,125
May God bless you!

156
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:17,833
Where are we?

157
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:18,833
Have we reached?

158
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,458
Abu Khaled!

159
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,166
Abu Khaled!

160
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,750
Get down.

161
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,250
I asked you to get down.
This is your workplace.

162
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,125
Can't you hear me?

163
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,666
What's going on?

164
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,375
Get down.

165
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,416
Get down.

166
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,541
No. You stay here.

167
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,708
You come with me.

168
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,041
-Hey, brother!
-Sir!

169
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,375
Sir!

170
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,166
We assumed our accommodation
would be in town.

171
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,208
We need to call our families.

172
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,708
-Phone call--
-You're blabbering too much!

173
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,833
Go! Go back to the vehicle!

174
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,708
Hakim, try to make
him understand somehow.

175
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,625
Isn't he asking me
to get back into the vehicle?

176
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,833
Don't you dare talk too much!
Go and get into the vehicle.

177
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,833
Don't be a pain in the neck! Go!

178
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,583
Kafeel, we are together…

179
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,666
Open your mouth and say something!

180
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,750
Hello!

181
00:15:24,452 --> 00:14:21,540
Hello, Abu Khaled!
Why have you locked the gate?

182
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,000
Due to the threat of wild animals.

183
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,083
Listen, Abu Khaled.

184
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,208
Let this boy stay here.

185
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,250
-Brother…
-I'll contact you tomorrow.

186
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,083
Kiddo, whether it’s English or Hindi,

187
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,666
just convey it in a language
you’re familiar with.

188
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,875
There is no other way.

189
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,916
Go!

190
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,250
Sir, Kafeel…

191
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,833
we've come on the same company's visa.

192
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,541
Helpers.

193
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,666
We stay together.

194
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,041
Shut up! Go back!

195
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,625
Go back! Quick!

196
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,333
Kafeel, we are together.

197
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,666
One room…

198
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,041
You move away.

199
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,458
Come on! Take him!

200
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,583
-Hakim!
-Brother!

201
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,208
Let go of me!

202
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,625
-We have come together!
-Hey! Go back, I say!

203
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,833
-Go back, I say!
-Brother!

204
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,666
-Listen to me!
-Why are you hitting me?

205
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,208
Go back, I say!

206
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,958
-Brother!
-Be careful with him!

207
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,916
-Brother!
-Don't let go of him!

208
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,541
-Why are you hitting me?
-Where are you going?

209
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,791
-Come on now!
-We have come together!

210
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,375
-Brother!
-Where are you going? Come back!

211
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,833
Come on!

212
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,541
-Don't go!
-Stop the vehicle!

213
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,208
-Don't go, Brother!
-Hakim!

214
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,166
Don't go!

215
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,208
-Hakim!
-Brother!

216
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,166
Praise be to Allah!

217
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,416
Get off.

218
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,541
Come on, get off.

219
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,416
Get down quickly.

220
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,375
Come on!
Get down quickly!

221
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,708
Where are you, Jaseer?
Are you sleeping?

222
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,625
No, Uncle. I'm not sleeping.
I'm here.

223
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,916
Yes, yes. I saw you.

224
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,666
Hello! How are you doing?

225
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,041
Doing great, by God's grace.

226
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,583
-Great.
-What's the latest news?

227
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,833
Latest news?

228
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,708
I've brought this Indian along.

229
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,208
Let him stay here.

230
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,833
We'll talk about
what to do with him tomorrow morning.

231
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,625
Okay, sir.

232
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,625
Go there. This is your workplace.

233
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,208
Where?

234
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,291
Karur Sreekumar said that
we'd be working in a company.

235
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,583
Go! Go with him!

236
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,333
Come on! Go and sleep
somewhere over there.

237
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,291
No.

238
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,333
Is he leaving?

239
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,083
I need to make a phone call.

240
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,625
You can use the telephone tomorrow.
Now go!

241
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,875
Goodbye! See you!

242
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,333
Bye! God willing!

243
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,833
-What? What are you saying?
-Oh, God! It's so cold!

244
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,166
This year, it's even colder.

245
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,541
Come!

246
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,791
Come on!

247
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,500
It's time to sleep!

248
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,333
Who is it?

249
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,208
Who are you?

250
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,458
What place is this?

251
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,458
Oh!

252
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,583
You're a Madrasi?

253
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,250
Why have you come here?

254
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,625
To work?

255
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,041
Hindi…

256
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,625
I'm a Tamilian.

257
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,958
Tamil?

258
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,958
Do you know
what kind of work is done here?

259
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,958
Can I get some water to drink?

260
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,625
Water.

261
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,000
Water?

262
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,375
Water is over there.

263
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,291
What was he even thinking?

264
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,625
Brother.

265
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,083
Where do I sleep?

266
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,666
What?

267
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,625
What are you saying?

268
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,375
Place to sleep?

269
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,125
-Where do I--
-Sleep anywhere you want.

270
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Najeeb, that's enough!

271
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:24,583
Let's get back.

272
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,833
I need to scoop out six more
baskets of sand to meet the target.

273
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,666
The mason will give me an earful
if we wait to meet the target.

274
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,375
We have molding work today.
Get back on the boat.

275
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,708
What's with the new style?

276
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,708
Have you switched
from beedis to cigarettes?

277
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,541
Foreign cigarettes. Take one.

278
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,916
My brother-in-law bought
them from the Middle East.

279
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,833
-No, thanks.
-Take one, man!

280
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,333
Even without smoking,
I still can't stop coughing.

281
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,708
You've had this cough for a while now.

282
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,666
Go and see a doctor.

283
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,291
If it turns out to be pneumonia,
you'll be in trouble.

284
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,958
The doctor has asked me
to quit this job altogether.

285
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,250
Is that even possible?

286
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,458
Hey, Santhosh!

287
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:05,000
Didn't your brother-in-law from Karur
bring anything from the Middle East?

288
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,375
He has brought two visas.

289
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,541
Do you want to go abroad?

290
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,583
I'm just waiting for the visa from God.

291
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,625
I needn't spend money on that, right?

292
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,916
It's a free visa.

293
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,333
Hey, Santhosh!
Is that thing about the visa true?

294
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,333
Why? Do you want to go?

295
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,750
It will cost a lot of money, right?

296
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,041
It will cost at least 30,000 rupees.

297
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,416
But you can earn it back with
just two months' salary, right?

298
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,166
Thirty thousand rupees?

299
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,375
I'll have to sell my house.

300
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,541
Why do you have to sell it?
You can mortgage it, right?

301
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,333
It's only a matter of two months.

302
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,833
I've only studied up to the fifth grade.
What kind of job could I get?

303
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,750
You're not going to work
as a bureaucrat there!

304
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,541
Why do you need education to work
as a laborer? You have a passport, right?

305
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,958
You arrange the money, man!
I'll get the visa ready.

306
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,250
There he is.
The one in red.

307
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,208
I told you
my brother-in-law would be here.

308
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,916
As far as I can remember,
he has only missed this festival once.

309
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:24,958
Last year.

310
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,083
-During the Kuwait war.
-Okay.

311
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,916
Otherwise, no matter where he is in
the world, he'll be here for the festival.

312
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:31,416
Come on.

313
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:32,750
Brother!

314
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:34,833
Brother!

315
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,583
Did you go to my house?

316
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,708
I knew that you would be here.

317
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,208
-This is Najeeb, the guy I told you about.
-Oh, yeah.

318
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,416
I'm Sreekumar.

319
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,833
People abroad know me
as Karur Sreekumar.

320
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:56,666
Shall we step aside and talk? Come.

321
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,333
Hey! Why are you late?

322
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,666
I cannot fly down like you, right?

323
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,541
Yeah, right!
Don't pull my leg!

324
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,833
I sold all my gold and other belongings

325
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,583
to arrange this somehow.

326
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,375
I know, man.

327
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:16,541
All Middle East expats
cross the sea like this.

328
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,250
Ask him what I had with me
when I got married to Kumuthavalli.

329
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,916
He was just a toddler running
around naked back then!

330
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,583
You are too much, brother!

331
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,750
I said that out of anxiety.

332
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,958
If I get cheated…

333
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,875
If you don't trust me,
you can have your money back.

334
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,666
I agreed only because he forced me.

335
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:36,875
There's a boy from Mayavaram
who's joining this company as a helper.

336
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,291
His father is in Dubai.

337
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,208
If I plan to deceive them,
do you think they'll be fooled?

338
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,500
No, brother!
That's not what I meant.

339
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,750
-My--
-Brother,

340
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,708
he has two brothers-in-law in Dubai.

341
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,625
To be honest, he married his wife
with the intention of settling down there.

342
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:49,583
Right?

343
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:50,916
What's the point in mentioning that now?

344
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,708
The anxiety of mortgaging my
house made me say that, brother.

345
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:56,125
Please don't misunderstand me.

346
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:58,958
Okay. You don't have to worry.

347
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,041
-Does it contain the full amount?
-Yes.

348
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,041
Pay the remaining 10,000 rupees
to the agent in Bombay.

349
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,916
-Only then will you get the visa. Got it?
-Okay.

350
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,250
Okay. Shall I make a move, then?

351
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,916
Hey, I had told Kumuthavalli
that you'd be coming home.

352
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,833
-Stop by there before you leave.
-Yes.

353
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,541
-Okay then! Carry on!
-Come.

354
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,708
We are taking the trouble
to make this unnecessarily, Sainu.

355
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,583
While he enjoys buffalo meat
and biryani there,

356
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,416
do you think he'll also eat your pickle?

357
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,250
Mom, the wealthy Arabs
eat camel meat there.

358
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,125
My brother Nasser brought some
when he visited once.

359
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,000
That reminds me!

360
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,708
Get him the phone numbers
of Nasser and Hussain.

361
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
They are his brothers-in-law, after all.

362
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:51,041
He can call them in case of an emergency.

363
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,250
Stop it, Mom!

364
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,208
I begged and pleaded many times
with my dear brothers

365
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,333
to arrange a visa for my husband.

366
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:57,791
Did they even bother?

367
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,583
Why do we need them now?

368
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,375
I'm waiting for Najeeb's first
money order to reach us!

369
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,958
I'm planning to purchase a copper vessel
from Kumbakonam and bring it home

370
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,000
so that my sister-in-law
can cook some biryani in it.

371
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,250
Mom, take this.

372
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,958
Make a delicious mutton curry
with added coconut shavings.

373
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:16,083
Don't get wet in the rain
and catch a fever before you leave.

374
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,500
Or do you want biryani, Sainu?

375
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:21,125
It's been a while since we had
Mom's biryani, right?

376
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,208
I'd like to have Mom's
mutton biryani before I leave.

377
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,375
What do you say?

378
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,666
You should have bought
a goat's head, too.

379
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,666
I would have made
some soup for her.

380
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,000
She needs to be eating properly
during this time.

381
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,625
I have arranged that.

382
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,125
You know Mammad, right?

383
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,375
I'll finish eating this
before boarding the plane.

384
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,416
I've asked Mammad to bring
a goat's head here every week

385
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:44,916
until her delivery.

386
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,791
After all, she's the wife
of a Middle East expat!

387
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,125
This is full of chili powder!

388
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,708
That's because you mocked me!

389
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:59,375
Am I really that desperate
to drink soup here?

390
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,958
The soup is not for you!
It's for my child!

391
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,666
Mom, did you hear that?
She thought the soup was for her!

392
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,708
Get out!
This is my tent!

393
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,541
-Let me lie down here.
-Get out!

394
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,583
It's really cold outside.

395
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,458
-Idiot! Don't you understand anything?
-Hey!

396
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,375
-I'll sleep here.
-Listen, you scoundrel!

397
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,458
-Please…
-If you repeat this, I'll break your legs!

398
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,166
I'll…

399
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:26,958
Bloody moron!
How dare he enter my tent!

400
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,541
Nuisance!

401
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,500
The day you stop giving milk,

402
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,833
you're dead meat.

403
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,833
Hey, Madrasi!

404
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,041
Come!

405
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:57,041
Come here.

406
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,250
I'm not from Madras.

407
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:07,416
I'm from Kumbakonam.

408
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,250
Tamil.

409
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,250
Najeeb.

410
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:13,666
What's your name, brother?

411
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,333
Your… name?
What is your name?

412
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,125
-My name?
-Yes.

413
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,500
I don't remember.

414
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:28,583
Take this milk to him inside.

415
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,166
Hindi… I don't…

416
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:33,500
No?

417
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,458
I don't understand Hindi.

418
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:38,541
Take… this milk… inside.

419
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:47,666
You scoundrel!

420
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,041
Who asked you to drink it?

421
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,625
-Didn't you ask me to drink it?
-Get lost!

422
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,375
Fool!

423
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,041
How do I make you understand?

424
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,583
This is not for you.

425
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,875
This is for the Kafeel.

426
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:06,416
The Arab! Over there!

427
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,791
Give it to him.

428
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:09,375
Go!

429
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:15,750
Of all people, the Kafeel
had to bring this Madrasi!

430
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,791
Useless!

431
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:28,541
Praise be to Allah!

432
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,583
Allah, protect me from all evil.

433
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,250
What is with you?

434
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,208
What are you doing over there?

435
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:43,208
Come on in!
Bring it here!

436
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,666
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you as well.

437
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,291
Do you know Arabic?

438
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:05,875
He knows Hindi.

439
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,166
Talk to him and learn
what has to be done here. Go.

440
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:12,916
Do you understand
what I'm saying? Do you?

441
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,666
I don't understand Arabic.

442
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:18,208
Go to him and learn how
to do the job. Quick!

443
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:21,000
What were you doing before this?

444
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,250
Tamil.

445
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:23,916
Tamil Nadu.

446
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,625
India…

447
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,458
I don't understand the Hindi language
you're blabbering.

448
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,041
Listen, don't give me a headache.

449
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:31,625
Watch that guy who speaks Hindi,
learn from him, and do your work.

450
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:32,791
-Go!
-Oh, my!

451
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,541
For God's sake, please save me.

452
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,041
I came here to work for a company.

453
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,666
For God's sake, please save me.
I beg you!

454
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,083
Go way! What is this?
May you be damned!

455
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,750
I sold everything I had to pay for…

456
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Damn you!

457
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,625
Sir, how do I even…

458
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,125
Let me leave.
I shall go back.

459
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,750
-Go! Go away!
-I shall go back!

460
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,583
Hey, Hindi! Come here.
Teach him how to do the job!

461
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,500
There's no point…

462
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,791
in crying.

463
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,458
Go!

464
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,208
Go away!

465
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,583
Go!

466
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,375
Oh, Allah!

467
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:39,583
Oh, Allah!

468
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:45,833
Peace be upon you.

469
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,250
Company--

470
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,083
They took money from me for the visa,

471
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:52,833
promising a job in a company,

472
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,416
along with an AC room to stay

473
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:56,666
and good food.

474
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:57,750
He cheated me!

475
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:58,916
Karur Sreekumar…

476
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,875
Kafeel!

477
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:00,833
Peace be upon you.

478
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,125
-Peace be upon you as well.
-How are you doing?

479
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,208
-I hope you are doing good.
-I need to make a phone call.

480
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:05,166
-All good.
-Phone…

481
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,333
Go and keep that sack inside.
Don't trouble me.

482
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,375
I need to call my family.

483
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:12,375
Oh, God!
Don't you understand?

484
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:15,458
Take that sack inside.
Don't drive me crazy!

485
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,208
He will learn everything
in due course.

486
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,291
Seems quite difficult.
He doesn't understand anything.

487
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,583
-He will understand,
-Oh, God.

488
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:27,750
just like the other guy…

489
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,708
How do I make them understand?

490
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,541
Get up!

491
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,000
Take this.

492
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,125
What is this for?

493
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,291
I will leave.
Let me go back.

494
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:46,208
-Please let me--
-Listen to me. Wear it!

495
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,125
-I don't--
-You better listen to him!

496
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,541
Go and wear it!

497
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,833
I sold everything I had to come here.

498
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:55,291
I'm sure he won't understand
anything. Such a nuisance!

499
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,041
Please hear me out, sir.

500
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,083
I arranged the money to come here
by mortgaging my house.

501
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,500
He thinks that we can
understand his language!

502
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,583
Unbelievable.

503
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,125
Sir…

504
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:16,833
I paid 20,000 rupees to this person
who said he would give it to the Kafeel.

505
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:18,750
Karur Sreekumar.

506
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:24,416
Even the agent in Bombay
took 10,000 rupees from me.

507
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,125
-Papers?
-Yes.

508
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,041
Hey! What are you doing?

509
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,333
Don't tear it!

510
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,708
-That's mine…
-How dare you!

511
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,000
Keep an eye on him so he
doesn't cause trouble for us later.

512
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,125
Don't bother about that.

513
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,083
He's new here.
He'll learn everything soon.

514
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,791
Come on.

515
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,416
Let us begin in the name of Allah.

516
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,333
Come here!

517
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
Come here, man!

518
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:27,625
I asked you to come!

519
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:29,166
Come!

520
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,500
Friend, come here!

521
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:43,916
Come. Have some bread.

522
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,833
Bread! This is bread!

523
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:02,875
Look at him.

524
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:06,541
There's a saying
that bread can revive a person.

525
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,916
You are right, sir.

526
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,250
Come on. Come!

527
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,208
Sit down! Sit!

528
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:28,875
Take it.

529
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:30,833
Take it.

530
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:42,333
Didn't I tell you that he must be hungry?

531
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,083
That's why he was so angry and finicky.

532
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:45,500
That's right.

533
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:47,375
Here you go.

534
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,000
Take one more piece.

535
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:50,916
Take it.

536
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,458
Be quick in learning
how to do the job, okay?

537
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:00,750
You heard me?

538
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,083
Drink some water.

539
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:08,583
Have it.

540
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,666
Drink it.

541
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,250
Drink it.

542
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:23,750
It's okay. Look.

543
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:26,250
Do this.

544
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,250
Do it.

545
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Dip it like this…

546
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,125
and eat it like this.

547
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:30,666
Brother!

548
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,166
Brother!

549
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,291
Why are you frightening my goats?

550
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:52,666
Where…

551
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,958
Road… Main road…

552
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:57,125
Where is it?

553
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:58,666
Road?

554
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,791
Yes.

555
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,541
Far away.

556
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:05,083
Far, far away.

557
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:09,750
Who knows how far.

558
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:42,333
I feel like I'm trapped
in the middle of the sea, Sainu.

559
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,000
How do I inform you about this?

560
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,791
TO MY DEAR SAINU…

561
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:28,166
Look at the sky.

562
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,958
Can't you see the moon
resembling a sliver of coconut?

563
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:55,833
Even if you can't call me,
just think of me when you see the moon…

564
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,708
wherever you are on this earth.

565
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,833
God has answered my prayers.

566
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,666
It must be the good fortune
of our child.

567
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:17,583
I'm not asking for much.

568
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:20,750
We need a room of our own,

569
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,875
a place to sit and talk like this.

570
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:27,000
Can we sneak into someone else's boat
like this once we have a child?

571
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:31,250
We need to fix the leaks in our kitchen.

572
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,250
And…

573
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:37,333
we should send our son to a good school.

574
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,208
That's all I need.

575
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,875
Have you decided that
we're going to have a son?

576
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:43,458
Don't you want a daughter?

577
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:44,958
I want a daughter as well.

578
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:47,416
Shouldn't we educate her
and raise her well?

579
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,958
Shouldn't we get her married?

580
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:51,416
You'll be an old man by then.

581
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,541
At most, four or five years.

582
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,166
Come back after that.

583
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,958
That's more than enough.

584
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,083
Is it?

585
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:02,458
Alright then.

586
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:06,166
Now, let me give my baby a kiss.

587
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:12,750
Nabeel.

588
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,875
Nabeel?

589
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,791
What if it's a girl?

590
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:18,916
Safiya.

591
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:21,750
Nabeel.

592
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,333
Safiya.

593
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:34,208
I think the train is about to arrive.

594
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,750
Son, keep your passport safe.

595
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:42,083
How many times
are you going to repeat the same thing?

596
00:44:47,869 --> 00:43:49,332
God will be with you.
I will pray for you.

597
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:52,000
I will inform the local phone booth.

598
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,041
You can wait there.

599
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,666
Shall I go?

600
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:04,125
Mom, take care of Sainu.

601
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:15,666
Move.

602
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,875
Brother, please move.

603
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,583
This is the one.

604
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:52,958
-What's your seat number?
-Thirty-nine.

605
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,000
Easy. Careful.

606
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:57,500
Okay.

607
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:58,708
I…

608
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:04,000
You're leaving with a small bag.

609
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,875
But make sure to bring big suitcases
when you come back!

610
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:07,041
Sure.

611
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,041
It's over here.

612
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:10,833
Brother, it's okay even if you
don't bring anything.

613
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,666
But just don't forget about the visas.

614
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:14,708
-Okay.
-Come on. The train will leave now.

615
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:16,083
-Shall we leave, brother?
-Okay.

616
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,333
Happy journey, Najeeb!

617
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:19,541
He's leaving his house
for the first time.

618
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,500
I feel relieved because you are with him.

619
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,625
That's why we came here
from Mayavaram, to board the train.

620
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,041
-Take care of him.
-Okay.

621
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:27,541
Mom, don't be so anxious.

622
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,625
Dear.

623
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:30,458
Call me as soon as you arrive in Bombay.

624
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,333
I will call you.

625
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,500
Don't get drenched and catch a fever.

626
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:37,166
Mom…

627
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,333
take her to the doctor, okay?

628
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:52,625
You bloody dog!

629
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,416
We pay money to buy this water!

630
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:56,666
The water is intended for use
in our work here.

631
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,666
-I was just--
-Do you know the value of water here?

632
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:00,000
I was taking a dump!

633
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:03,625
If you touch it again,
I'll chop off your hands!

634
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,333
-If you take the water away, how will I--
-I pay money for it, and he's wasting it!

635
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:08,541
Water!

636
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:10,750
He pays good money to buy water!

637
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:15,500
Without water, how do I…

638
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,500
This is so bothersome!

639
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,166
Not water!

640
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:22,833
Use sand!

641
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,666
Damn it!

642
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,083
Brother!

643
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,750
Can you take me with you?

644
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:44,791
What?

645
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,208
When you head back,
can I ride with you in your vehicle?

646
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:50,458
What are you saying, brother?
I don't understand anything.

647
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:51,958
To the road. In your vehicle.

648
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:53,625
Can you take me with you?

649
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,250
What did this rascal tell you?

650
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,333
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

651
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,208
Come here.
Where are you going?

652
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,708
Come here.

653
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:03,708
I know what he said.

654
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:07,333
Wasn't he asking you to help him escape?

655
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:08,291
No.

656
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,625
What were you telling him?

657
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:14,583
I didn't say anything.

658
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,083
I overheard you talking to him!

659
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,708
What were you blabbering to him?

660
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,416
I didn't tell him anything.

661
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:25,291
-Didn't you hear me?
-Why are you hitting me?

662
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,541
-I didn't say anything!
-What did you…

663
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:28,541
Let me go!

664
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,166
Let me go back!

665
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,500
I will go back!

666
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:35,083
You're fighting back?

667
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,166
Bloody scoundrel!
I'll teach you a lesson!

668
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,291
I'll show you!

669
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:46,958
What did he tell you?

670
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:49,541
I don't know.
The Kafeel was saying something.

671
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:52,083
Don't mess with him.

672
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,708
He can do anything.

673
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:01,375
You bloody scoundrel!

674
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:03,166
Bloody devil!

675
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,208
Do you think you can
fight back against me?

676
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:07,250
Sure! I'll kill you, you bloody dog!

677
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,875
Boss, he didn't tell me anything.

678
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:10,208
You shut up!

679
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:11,958
You don't need to get involved in this!

680
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,583
Why are you shouting at him?
He didn't tell me anything.

681
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:16,166
I didn't tell him anything.

682
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:18,166
You're grabbing my gun?

683
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:22,791
I'll pull the trigger
and blow your head off!

684
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,208
How dare you fight me, you dog?

685
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:31,750
I'll kill you and bury you in this desert.

686
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,166
Understood?

687
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:41,125
What are you staring at?

688
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:43,083
Can't you see the water overflowing?

689
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:44,208
Come on!

690
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,000
Idiots! You are all stupid!

691
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:13,541
Hey, girl!

692
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,625
Aren't you ashamed to bathe like this?

693
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:16,750
What's there to be ashamed of?

694
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:18,708
I'm bathing inside the bathroom.

695
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:22,250
We have such a beautiful river here.
You should be diving in there.

696
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,000
Hey, dear! What are you doing?

697
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,083
Someone might see!

698
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,250
I'm going to take you to the river today.

699
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,458
Dear, no!

700
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,958
Hey!

701
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:32,666
No! Najeeb, I feel shy!

702
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:36,208
-Let go of me, dear!
-Don't tremble!

703
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:39,666
-Mom, please ask him to leave me!
-What are you doing?

704
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:41,250
Where are you taking her?

705
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,083
Didn't you mention that
Dad carried you to the market?

706
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:46,583
But I was only 12 years old back then!

707
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:47,541
Mom!

708
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:50,083
Well, she's ten years older than that.
It's fine.

709
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:51,750
Let go of me! I'm scared!

710
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:54,208
Hey, Najeeb!
Hasn't it been nearly a year?

711
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:56,125
Is there no end to your craving even now?

712
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:58,958
Brother, my craving won't be satisfied
until her shyness disappears.

713
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,666
Hey! What are you saying?

714
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,500
I'm going to make you overcome
your fear of getting into the river.

715
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,250
Are you scared?

716
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,208
I'm scared!

717
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,041
Sainu…

718
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:31,875
Sainu…

719
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:41,291
Sainu!

720
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:50,500
Even after eating so much, you're still…

721
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:53,625
making these noises.

722
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,125
I think…

723
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:03,500
I'll die trying to feed you guys.

724
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:07,166
Brother…

725
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:11,666
Where have you been?

726
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:14,458
How long has it been…

727
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,875
How long has it been
since you came here?

728
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:28,958
"No one inside can go outside."

729
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,833
It's a very famous song!

730
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:40,666
No one inside can go outside

731
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:47,416
No one outside can come inside…

732
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:02,250
Hey, Hindi!
Get up!

733
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:06,916
Come on!

734
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,666
It's already late! Come on!

735
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:28,416
Milk the goats and bring me the milk.

736
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:31,500
Milk the goats and bring me the milk!

737
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:40,000
Come on!
Milk the goats and bring me the milk.

738
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:43,416
Come and milk the goats!
Hurry up!

739
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,250
Come on!

740
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:50,375
Quick! How can you still be sleeping
when the sun is already up?

741
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:52,083
Oh, God!

742
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:53,625
What is he saying?

743
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,791
Come here and milk the goats.

744
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:57,875
I…

745
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,541
I don't know how to milk the goats.

746
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:03,541
Milk them like this. Understood?

747
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:06,666
I…

748
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:09,041
How do I tell him that I don't…

749
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:10,875
Come on.
Come quickly.

750
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:13,791
I don't know… how to milk them.

751
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,208
-I don't know…
-Come on. Come quickly.

752
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:35,208
You idiot!

753
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,416
Don't try to milk it from the back.
You will get kicked!

754
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:40,000
Approach from the front
and gently befriend it.

755
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,500
I don't know how to do this job.

756
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:45,625
Where's that Hindi guy?

757
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,250
Listen.

758
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:50,708
Hold its legs, and keep them
in between your legs…

759
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:52,583
and then stroke it slowly.

760
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:54,375
Then try holding it.

761
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:57,208
And then, try milking it slowly.

762
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,875
-Understood?
-The…

763
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,458
The Hindi guy?

764
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:02,958
Isn't this his job?

765
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:06,958
What happened to him?

766
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,541
Stop blabbering and listen to me.

767
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:12,666
You also have other tasks to complete.
Don't cause trouble for me!

768
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:15,250
There are other jobs to do after this.
Go on!

769
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:17,583
Milk the goats.

770
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,333
There are things to do!
Hurry up!

771
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:31,375
This guy is the limit!
When is he going to learn all this?

772
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:40,875
Please…

773
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:43,416
Please don't get me beaten up.

774
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:45,625
I…

775
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:47,958
I don't know how to do this job.

776
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:14,375
Go!

777
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:21,958
Go!

778
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:23,500
Go!

779
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:25,250
Go!

780
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:30,375
Hey!

781
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:36,458
Go!

782
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:44,833
What are you doing, you idiot?

783
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:11,166
Are you fighting with the goats?

784
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,500
Get up!

785
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:37,916
Get up! Are you crazy?

786
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,625
Be thankful to your Gods
that you're not dead.

787
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,166
Water.

788
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:55,916
That's enough!

789
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,375
Go and take the goats back!

790
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:01,166
I won't give you another drop of water.

791
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,125
Get up! Take this.
Get up!

792
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:05,458
Come on! Get up!

793
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:16,291
Get up!

794
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:18,250
Get up!
Go on, bring the goats.

795
01:05:22,291 --> 01:05:23,166
Oh, God.

796
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:27,333
I'm hurt.

797
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:30,750
I need to go to the hospital.

798
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:34,250
Stop blabbering
and take the goats back. Go!

799
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:36,458
I need to go to the hospital.

800
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:38,416
I asked you to take them back!

801
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,250
Hurry up!

802
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:43,458
This guy is so bothersome!

803
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:54,500
I can't do this.

804
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:57,500
Allah!

805
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,541
Allah!

806
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,083
This is such a terrible situation.
Everyone has started buying machines.

807
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:43,666
But you're still the same.

808
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:46,375
You won't finish cutting this
even in one month.

809
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,500
This is easier than using a machine.

810
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:50,166
We've practiced this for a while now.

811
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:52,291
You are right, Jaseer.

812
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,583
We must change with the times.

813
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,916
If you take so much time to cut this,

814
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,875
there won't be any money left
to pay you when we sell it.

815
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,625
What are you doing?

816
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:05,666
Bring them quickly!

817
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:06,958
What's the purpose of making these sounds?

818
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:10,416
How many have you cut, Jaseer?

819
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:12,500
I'm doing it, sir.
It will be over now.

820
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:15,125
That's not enough.
Finish the rest quickly.

821
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:17,125
Don't you know
what the market is like right now?

822
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:46,666
You rascal!

823
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:48,666
What are you looking at in the mirror?

824
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,083
Admiring your beauty?!

825
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Get back to work!

826
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:53,791
He's admiring his looks!

827
01:08:54,416 --> 01:08:55,291
Idiot!

828
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,333
This beard…

829
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,250
How long has it been?

830
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:46,458
How many days has it been?

831
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:52,291
I can't remember anything.

832
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:55,958
How long…

833
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,833
I can't do this, Mom.

834
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:18,083
I'm exhausted, Mom.

835
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:23,000
I'm fed up.

836
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,666
I'm sick and tired.

837
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:32,458
God, I can't…

838
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:42,333
Why should I call on God?

839
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:48,541
Why should I pray to God?

840
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:51,916
If there were a God…

841
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:57,333
my fate wouldn't be like this.

842
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:33,125
Brother!

843
01:12:44,541 --> 01:12:45,583
Brother…

844
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,500
Mom.

845
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:53,791
I need to go.

846
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,791
I must go back.

847
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:00,458
I don't care even if I die.

848
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:03,833
I must leave.

849
01:16:11,791 --> 01:16:13,541
Stop there, you dog!

850
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:16,708
Go!

851
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:07,250
-You dog!
-Hey…

852
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:08,291
Stop there, you!

853
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:11,541
Where do you think you're trying
to escape to, you swine?

854
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:14,125
Where are you going?
Stay there, you swine!

855
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:17,541
Are you running away from me?
You dog!

856
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:24,416
What were you thinking?
I'll teach you a lesson, you dog!

857
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:25,750
You scoundrel!

858
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,583
I will kill you, you filthy animal!

859
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:31,666
How dare you run away from me?

860
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,333
Where were you trying to escape to?

861
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:31,541
Hey!

862
01:26:04,916 --> 01:26:05,833
Who is that?

863
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:08,916
It's me.

864
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:14,250
It's me!

865
01:26:14,916 --> 01:26:16,166
Brother…

866
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:24,166
Hakim!

867
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:26,125
Kiddo!

868
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Brother…

869
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:37,750
I can't believe this!

870
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:42,750
Only your voice is the same.

871
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:44,708
You look so different.

872
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:49,916
Only your voice is the same!

873
01:26:58,291 --> 01:27:00,208
Hakim…

874
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:07,041
I will die, brother!

875
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:11,541
I will… die here!

876
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:14,333
How long has it been?

877
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,416
How many years has it been?

878
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:23,875
I don't know anything.

879
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,833
I don't know anything!

880
01:27:27,958 --> 01:27:31,250
Come on, brother.
Let's get out of here.

881
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:33,125
Let's escape from here. Come!

882
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:38,000
How?

883
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:41,083
Where to?

884
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:44,791
I tried so many times.

885
01:27:45,583 --> 01:27:49,208
I tried for so many days!

886
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:57,166
It's been only a few days
since I came here.

887
01:27:57,375 --> 01:28:02,208
I was made to work
at several places before that.

888
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:04,166
They tortured me!

889
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:09,083
Brother, that's my Kafeel.

890
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,333
I'm leaving.

891
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:12,458
I'm not afraid of dying now.

892
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:13,583
I could see you, right?

893
01:28:13,666 --> 01:28:14,791
-Hakim…
-I was able to see you.

894
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:16,291
I'm leaving.

895
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:23,541
Go back, brother!

896
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:24,958
Don't let him spot you!

897
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:02,041
Brother!

898
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:14,166
Brother!

899
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,125
Brother!

900
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:42,000
What are you doing there?

901
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:46,041
-I'm taking a dump.
-Taking a dump?

902
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,291
Where are you taking a dump?

903
01:30:49,166 --> 01:30:50,083
Listen!

904
01:30:50,541 --> 01:30:54,541
Take the camels back to the Masara
before the sandstorm arrives.

905
01:30:55,291 --> 01:31:00,000
I'm telling you, take the camels
back to the Masara before sunset.

906
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:33,250
Brother, I was severely beaten that day.

907
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:36,291
That's alright.
I'm happy that I was able to meet you.

908
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:39,750
I've only been working here
for a few days.

909
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:42,250
There's an African man
who works with me here.

910
01:31:42,416 --> 01:31:44,833
He has worked here earlier as well.

911
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,125
He's very familiar with most
of the routes and locations here.

912
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:51,375
If he helps us, we can escape.

913
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:54,958
I feel like he has been sent to us
like Allah sent Prophet Moses.

914
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:57,458
Let's pray to the Almighty.

915
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:52,625
Hakim, come!

916
01:32:55,458 --> 01:32:56,416
Quick!

917
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:07,791
Look! That's your friend's Masara.

918
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:07,708
It's okay.

919
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:09,375
Hakim!

920
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:11,750
What is it?

921
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:13,125
Nothing, brother.

922
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:16,166
-What happened?
-This is Khadiri.

923
01:35:20,875 --> 01:35:21,875
Peace be upon you!

924
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:24,750
Ibrahim Khadiri.

925
01:35:26,708 --> 01:35:27,625
How are you doing?

926
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:30,916
-Are you Hakim's friend?
-Yes.

927
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:34,833
Brother, Khadiri knows all the places
and routes here very well.

928
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:36,250
He's from Africa.

929
01:35:38,083 --> 01:35:41,125
Escaping from the Kafeel
is quite difficult.

930
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:44,833
But the Kafeel's daughter's
wedding is coming up.

931
01:35:45,375 --> 01:35:46,625
When the Kafeels go
for the wedding celebrations,

932
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:47,958
it might give us a window to escape.

933
01:35:48,708 --> 01:35:49,791
May God help us.

934
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:53,250
-Hakim…
-Tell him.

935
01:35:53,666 --> 01:35:56,833
Brother, our chief Kafeel's daughter's
wedding is coming up in a few days.

936
01:35:57,083 --> 01:36:01,666
By God's grace, if they leave this place
that day, we can make our escape.

937
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:10,250
Didn't you understand
what I said, brother?

938
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:14,083
How?

939
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,041
So…

940
01:36:20,041 --> 01:36:21,125
far away.

941
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:22,500
Can we do it?

942
01:36:23,916 --> 01:36:26,625
Why are you speaking like this, brother?

943
01:36:29,875 --> 01:36:32,000
If we can't escape, we'll die together.

944
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:34,250
Should we stay here and suffer?

945
01:36:34,541 --> 01:36:36,500
-Hakim…
-I can't do this anymore.

946
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:39,500
I can't do this anymore.

947
01:36:43,166 --> 01:36:44,166
Let's go.

948
01:36:44,541 --> 01:36:47,291
Let's leave this place somehow.

949
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:50,583
Hey, don't cry.

950
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:52,458
Don't cry.

951
01:36:53,125 --> 01:36:54,416
Come on, let's go.

952
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:57,708
See you!
God willing!

953
01:36:58,375 --> 01:37:00,416
Brother, everything will be alright.

954
01:37:00,791 --> 01:37:02,125
Pray to God.

955
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:31,833
Dear friends!
I greatly appreciate your presence.

956
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:34,000
May God bless you!

957
01:37:34,958 --> 01:37:36,166
May God bless you!

958
01:37:41,041 --> 01:37:43,416
May God bless you all.

959
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:57,291
-You are most welcome.
-Thank you.

960
01:37:57,416 --> 01:38:01,458
-I'm pleased to see you.
-Thank you.

961
01:38:01,541 --> 01:38:03,833
Welcome! Please come.

962
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:14,958
Hey, Hindi!

963
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
You're sitting here?

964
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:20,458
Take this.

965
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:22,500
Here, have some meat.

966
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,375
Eat it. It's for the special occasion
of my daughter's wedding.

967
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
God willing! On the wedding day,
we will serve you biryani.

968
01:39:04,958 --> 01:39:06,000
Allah!

969
01:39:06,333 --> 01:39:07,541
You are right!

970
01:39:10,458 --> 01:39:11,541
What's with you?

971
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:14,291
Go and unload the goods from the vehicle.

972
01:39:14,416 --> 01:39:16,541
I have to go to the wedding. Quick!

973
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:17,708
Alright.

974
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,750
Are you peeking at me from there?

975
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:23,916
That's an awesome speaker.

976
01:39:24,916 --> 01:39:26,500
It has such great bass!

977
01:39:27,791 --> 01:39:28,750
Unload it quickly.

978
01:39:30,416 --> 01:39:32,541
He has to go to the wedding.

979
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:39,541
Oh, God!

980
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:42,083
I'll die in this heat.

981
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:43,750
Hey!

982
01:39:49,541 --> 01:39:51,083
Hey! Don't worry.

983
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,041
You'll be getting
some of the wedding biryani, too.

984
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:56,250
-Sir!
-Yes!

985
01:39:56,333 --> 01:39:58,083
I have unloaded the goods.
I'm leaving.

986
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:01,125
Come tomorrow. I'll get you
some biryani from the wedding feast.

987
01:40:01,958 --> 01:40:03,708
Hey, you! Hindi!
Come on!

988
01:40:04,375 --> 01:40:05,291
Here.

989
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,583
Take it.
This is your dinner for tonight.

990
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:11,333
I'll lock up the Masara and then
head to Kafeel's daughter's wedding.

991
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:14,791
If I'm held up, I won't return
until tomorrow morning.

992
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:17,000
Understood? Okay, bye.

993
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:18,916
Okay. May God protect you.

994
01:44:30,291 --> 01:44:31,250
Don't scream.

995
01:45:37,702 --> 01:44:46,207
I'll feed you.

996
01:44:46,208 --> 01:44:47,250
Eat it.

997
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:50,041
Eat until your stomach explodes.

998
01:44:53,333 --> 01:44:54,458
I'm leaving, my dear.

999
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,500
I won't be coming back.

1000
01:45:32,541 --> 01:45:33,541
I'm leaving.

1001
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,125
I'm leaving.

1002
01:45:42,416 --> 01:45:43,791
Even if I have to face death, I'm leaving!

1003
01:45:52,833 --> 01:45:54,250
Someone else will come…

1004
01:45:55,541 --> 01:45:57,083
to take care of all of you.

1005
01:45:58,416 --> 01:45:59,541
Just like me.

1006
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:03,666
I'm going back home.

1007
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:05,541
I'm going back home.

1008
01:46:08,375 --> 01:46:09,375
Brother!

1009
01:46:10,833 --> 01:46:12,041
Come quickly!

1010
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:14,791
Khadiri is getting impatient!

1011
01:46:17,583 --> 01:46:19,375
We need to hit the road
before it gets dark.

1012
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:22,666
Brother, don't you
want to leave this place?

1013
01:46:28,916 --> 01:46:29,791
Brother!

1014
01:46:30,458 --> 01:46:32,708
Brother, you look completely different.

1015
01:46:34,083 --> 01:46:35,583
I never wore these clothes.

1016
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:39,708
I was saving them to wear
when I finally return home.

1017
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,125
Khadiri didn't even let me
change out of these dirty clothes.

1018
01:46:43,458 --> 01:46:45,833
He hurriedly dragged me
out of my workplace

1019
01:46:45,958 --> 01:46:47,166
as soon as the Kafeel left.

1020
01:46:47,333 --> 01:46:50,250
Hurry up!
We need to hit the road before sunset!

1021
01:47:03,833 --> 01:47:05,666
SAINU

1022
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:19,625
Don't take that bag, brother.

1023
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:21,875
If people notice us leaving with bags,

1024
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,541
they'll figure out that
we're trying to escape.

1025
01:47:25,166 --> 01:47:26,458
Don't take the bag!

1026
01:47:26,666 --> 01:47:28,791
People will figure out that
we're trying to escape!

1027
01:47:29,166 --> 01:47:30,250
Come quickly!

1028
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:32,208
Khadiri is also asking you
not to bring your bag.

1029
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:33,541
Why do you need this bag?

1030
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:35,958
Leave it here.
I haven't taken anything either.

1031
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:40,458
How can I just abandon it?

1032
01:47:41,166 --> 01:47:42,166
Come fast!

1033
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:43,583
Hurry up!

1034
01:47:45,166 --> 01:47:46,458
That's okay, brother.
Come on!

1035
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:30,083
This is so tiresome.

1036
01:48:31,666 --> 01:48:32,791
Brother,

1037
01:48:33,208 --> 01:48:36,541
shall we go there
and drink some water?

1038
01:48:39,208 --> 01:48:40,333
Friend.

1039
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,583
Can we go there
and drink some water?

1040
01:48:44,041 --> 01:48:45,083
No, no.

1041
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:46,625
If we go there, they'll catch us.

1042
01:48:48,333 --> 01:48:50,875
-They might mistake us for thieves.
-No, no, no.

1043
01:48:51,083 --> 01:48:53,458
We want water.

1044
01:48:53,833 --> 01:48:56,500
Oh, God! How do I tell him
that I'm thirsty?

1045
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:57,625
Water.

1046
01:48:58,458 --> 01:48:59,458
Wait here.

1047
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:01,666
Don't move.

1048
01:49:02,583 --> 01:49:04,416
Sit. I'll bring water.

1049
01:49:25,208 --> 01:49:28,250
Thief! Thief! Thief!

1050
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:32,125
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1051
01:49:32,208 --> 01:49:33,083
Ibrahim!

1052
01:49:33,208 --> 01:49:34,333
Ibrahim!

1053
01:49:34,416 --> 01:49:35,708
Brother, come!

1054
01:49:36,541 --> 01:49:37,958
Come.

1055
01:49:45,916 --> 01:49:47,000
Hakim!

1056
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:49,250
My bag!

1057
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:51,125
My bag…

1058
01:49:51,916 --> 01:49:53,125
Brother, come!

1059
01:49:57,083 --> 01:49:58,083
Come quickly!

1060
01:50:00,666 --> 01:50:01,833
Come on!

1061
01:50:02,208 --> 01:50:03,333
Najeeb!

1062
01:50:03,458 --> 01:50:04,833
Is that a thief?

1063
01:50:07,916 --> 01:50:09,458
Shine the light on him.

1064
01:50:09,541 --> 01:50:11,750
I'm right behind him.
I can see him.

1065
01:50:12,458 --> 01:50:13,833
Stop! Stop him!

1066
01:50:13,916 --> 01:50:15,750
I can see him.
Shine the light on him.

1067
01:50:20,458 --> 01:50:21,541
Come quickly!

1068
01:51:18,125 --> 01:51:19,083
Hakim.

1069
01:51:20,791 --> 01:51:21,875
Hakim.

1070
01:52:15,458 --> 01:52:16,500
Oh, God.

1071
01:52:17,375 --> 01:52:19,208
Where are we going?

1072
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,166
I can't see the road anywhere.

1073
01:52:23,083 --> 01:52:25,166
I think we've veered way off course.

1074
01:52:26,375 --> 01:52:27,375
Friend!

1075
01:52:27,875 --> 01:52:28,875
Ibrahim!

1076
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:30,541
No road.

1077
01:52:31,458 --> 01:52:32,708
Are we on the right path?

1078
01:52:33,875 --> 01:52:35,875
Can't see any vehicle tracks here.

1079
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:38,333
-Road?
-This is not the route.

1080
01:52:39,625 --> 01:52:42,000
We're just following the sun.
Come quickly.

1081
01:52:45,208 --> 01:52:47,375
We're simply heading westward,
following the sun.

1082
01:52:48,125 --> 01:52:50,041
Khadiri knows what he's doing.

1083
01:52:50,833 --> 01:52:53,541
We deviated from the route
while running. That's why.

1084
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:05,416
Water!

1085
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:09,458
Water!

1086
01:53:17,125 --> 01:53:19,291
Is the camel drinking water over there?

1087
01:53:20,083 --> 01:53:21,166
Thank God!

1088
01:53:22,041 --> 01:53:22,916
Come, brother!

1089
01:53:23,875 --> 01:53:25,708
Friend, look!

1090
01:53:26,416 --> 01:53:28,375
-No!
-Camel! Water!

1091
01:53:29,041 --> 01:53:30,250
Don't go there!

1092
01:53:32,583 --> 01:53:33,541
No water!

1093
01:53:34,041 --> 01:53:35,958
Heat! Desert heat!

1094
01:53:45,666 --> 01:53:47,250
Brother!

1095
01:53:48,416 --> 01:53:49,708
Brother!

1096
01:53:50,916 --> 01:53:52,750
Brother, over there…

1097
01:53:52,833 --> 01:53:55,000
It's dead.

1098
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:02,041
It's a dead camel!

1099
01:54:02,208 --> 01:54:03,791
It will take years to decompose.

1100
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:06,583
We're running out of time. Let's go!

1101
01:54:11,541 --> 01:54:14,958
It must have died of thirst.

1102
01:55:02,083 --> 01:55:03,000
Hakim!

1103
01:55:07,541 --> 01:55:09,458
-What?
-Snake!

1104
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:16,750
Don't move!

1105
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:52,375
Brother! Are you okay?

1106
01:55:55,208 --> 01:55:57,166
The snakes were on my feet.

1107
01:55:57,291 --> 01:55:59,666
Oh, no!
There's a scratch.

1108
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:01,291
Oh, God!

1109
01:56:01,625 --> 01:56:02,583
Did it bite him?

1110
01:56:02,958 --> 01:56:04,500
What happened?

1111
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:05,750
It's nothing.

1112
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:07,666
If the snake had bitten him,

1113
01:56:08,541 --> 01:56:09,750
he would have died immediately.

1114
01:56:10,333 --> 01:56:12,083
-What is he saying?
-It didn't bite you.

1115
01:56:20,958 --> 01:56:22,208
This is the medicine of the desert.

1116
01:56:23,375 --> 01:56:24,666
Medicine. Good.

1117
01:56:26,833 --> 01:56:28,083
Allah.

1118
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,250
Praise be to God.

1119
01:56:48,833 --> 01:56:51,125
Glory be to God.

1120
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:53,916
Friend.

1121
01:56:55,833 --> 01:56:56,875
Friend!

1122
01:56:58,250 --> 01:56:59,250
Get up!

1123
01:57:00,041 --> 01:57:01,666
-Get up.
-Have we reached the road?

1124
01:57:01,916 --> 01:57:03,041
You have rested enough.

1125
01:57:04,875 --> 01:57:06,625
Have we reached?

1126
01:57:08,541 --> 01:57:10,416
We'll reach today, God willing.

1127
01:57:11,583 --> 01:57:13,333
God sees.

1128
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:18,500
Brother…

1129
01:57:20,041 --> 01:57:23,000
Brother, wake up.

1130
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:25,833
We need to start walking
before it gets late.

1131
01:57:29,916 --> 01:57:31,625
My feet…

1132
01:57:33,833 --> 01:57:35,541
My feet!

1133
01:57:37,833 --> 01:57:38,750
Oh, God!

1134
01:57:39,083 --> 01:57:43,291
It's full of blisters
since you were walking barefoot.

1135
01:57:45,708 --> 01:57:48,041
My feet have swollen up.

1136
01:57:49,208 --> 01:57:50,500
Friend.

1137
01:57:51,958 --> 01:57:53,083
Wound.

1138
01:57:53,916 --> 01:57:54,791
Wound.

1139
01:57:57,666 --> 01:57:59,291
Take a look.

1140
01:57:59,791 --> 01:58:01,458
You're wounded since
you were walking barefoot.

1141
01:58:06,208 --> 01:58:08,958
-Since you were walking barefoot…
-Let's tie this up.

1142
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:11,833
This will help you walk.

1143
01:58:18,875 --> 01:58:20,125
Oh, God!

1144
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:22,916
With these feet…

1145
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:10,791
Oh, no!

1146
01:59:11,583 --> 01:59:13,083
Where are we…

1147
01:59:14,041 --> 01:59:15,208
going?

1148
01:59:18,291 --> 01:59:22,250
Why aren't we getting anywhere?

1149
01:59:24,125 --> 01:59:28,375
Satan is sending us around in circles.

1150
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:29,500
Hakim!

1151
01:59:29,833 --> 01:59:30,708
Hakim!

1152
01:59:31,666 --> 01:59:33,000
Kiddo!

1153
01:59:33,416 --> 01:59:35,291
Hey! Open your eyes!

1154
01:59:35,708 --> 01:59:36,708
Hey!

1155
01:59:39,958 --> 01:59:41,791
Open your eyes! Open…

1156
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,416
Hey, Hakim!

1157
01:59:43,791 --> 01:59:45,208
Friend, you're not tired!

1158
01:59:46,583 --> 01:59:47,708
Stand up!

1159
01:59:48,041 --> 01:59:49,833
Stay strong!
Stand up!

1160
01:59:51,291 --> 01:59:53,125
Shut up, bloody dog!

1161
01:59:53,708 --> 01:59:55,916
Don't utter another word!

1162
01:59:57,541 --> 02:00:03,166
If I had been back there, I could
have at least gotten some water.

1163
02:00:06,333 --> 02:00:07,208
Hakim.

1164
02:00:07,958 --> 02:00:08,875
Hakim.

1165
02:00:11,125 --> 02:00:12,375
-Kiddo.
-Water.

1166
02:05:14,958 --> 02:05:16,500
-Hakim!
-Road!

1167
02:05:16,625 --> 02:05:18,500
Road! We have reached!

1168
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,375
Brother, it's the road.

1169
02:05:22,416 --> 02:05:23,375
Road!

1170
02:05:24,208 --> 02:05:25,208
Road!

1171
02:05:29,125 --> 02:05:30,250
Hakim!

1172
02:05:35,666 --> 02:05:36,791
Hakim!

1173
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:15,416
Hakim!

1174
02:06:28,125 --> 02:06:29,208
Hakim…

1175
02:07:01,541 --> 02:07:03,500
Hakim!

1176
02:07:04,416 --> 02:07:06,416
You are fine, Hakim!

1177
02:07:06,625 --> 02:07:08,375
Hey, kiddo! Hakim!

1178
02:07:08,625 --> 02:07:09,500
Hey!

1179
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:11,916
Hakim!

1180

Hakim!

1181
02:07:18,583 --> 02:07:19,458
Hakim!

1182
02:07:19,833 --> 02:07:20,833
Hakim!

1183
02:07:23,708 --> 02:07:24,666
Hakim!

1184
02:07:26,666 --> 02:07:27,541
Hey!

1185
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:28,625
Kiddo.

1186
02:07:34,125 --> 02:07:37,208
Save him! Please do something!

1187
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:38,875
Do something…

1188
02:07:39,416 --> 02:07:40,541
Save him!

1189
02:07:40,708 --> 02:07:42,416
Do something!

1190
02:07:43,083 --> 02:07:44,708
-Do something!
-Sorry.

1191
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,625
-Please do something!
-Sorry.

1192
02:07:49,791 --> 02:07:51,333
Save him.

1193
02:07:55,458 --> 02:07:56,791
Save him.

1194
02:08:15,666 --> 02:08:16,708
Hakim!

1195
02:08:17,041 --> 02:08:18,125
Hakim!

1196
02:08:18,291 --> 02:08:21,541
Hakim! You are fine, kiddo!

1197
02:08:22,958 --> 02:08:24,041
Hakim!

1198
02:08:24,625 --> 02:08:25,791
Hey!

1199
02:08:28,583 --> 02:08:29,750
Hakim…

1200
02:08:29,958 --> 02:08:31,041
Hey!

1201
02:08:31,458 --> 02:08:32,791
Hey, Hakim!

1202
02:08:33,041 --> 02:08:34,041
Hakim!

1203
02:09:20,625 --> 02:09:21,666
Najeeb!

1204
02:09:22,041 --> 02:09:23,041
Najeeb!

1205
02:09:23,625 --> 02:09:24,958
Najeeb, come quickly!

1206
02:09:25,708 --> 02:09:26,625
Leave him!

1207
02:09:27,166 --> 02:09:28,541
-Hakim…
-Hurry up!

1208
02:09:29,333 --> 02:09:30,833
Hurry up!

1209
02:09:30,916 --> 02:09:32,333
-He's gone…
-Come! Quick!

1210
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:35,291
Let's take him with us.
He'll be all alone here.

1211
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:36,625
Hakim.

1212
02:09:36,708 --> 02:09:38,166
He will be all alone here.

1213
02:09:40,666 --> 02:09:43,833
Let's take him with us.
He'll be all alone here.

1214
02:09:43,958 --> 02:09:45,000
Hakim!

1215
02:09:47,291 --> 02:09:48,541
Hakim!

1216
02:09:51,666 --> 02:09:53,208
He will be all alone here.

1217
02:10:11,375 --> 02:10:13,916
Let go of me!

1218
02:10:16,458 --> 02:10:18,500
Let go of me! Hakim!

1219
02:10:28,458 --> 02:10:29,583
Hakim!

1220
02:10:47,333 --> 02:10:48,500
I can't see!

1221
02:11:40,166 --> 02:11:41,333
Hakim!

1222
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:49,208
Hakim!

1223
02:11:50,333 --> 02:11:52,208
Hakim!

1224
02:11:52,958 --> 02:11:54,916
Hakim!

1225
02:11:57,625 --> 02:11:59,041
Hakim is gone…

1226
02:12:21,833 --> 02:12:23,125
Hakim!

1227
02:12:25,458 --> 02:12:26,333
Kiddo.

1228
02:13:19,250 --> 02:13:20,750
Praise be to God.

1229
02:13:28,833 --> 02:13:30,333
Najeeb, get up.

1230
02:13:39,666 --> 02:13:40,583
Najeeb!

1231
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:42,166
Come on.

1232
02:13:51,458 --> 02:13:52,375
Get up!

1233
02:13:52,833 --> 02:13:53,750
Up, now!

1234
02:13:55,333 --> 02:13:56,208
Get up!

1235
02:13:56,791 --> 02:13:57,875
Up!

1236
02:14:06,708 --> 02:14:08,208
Must walk.

1237
02:14:10,791 --> 02:14:11,833
Must walk.

1238
02:14:15,625 --> 02:14:17,166
We must walk till we die.

1239
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Najeeb.

1240
02:15:01,125 --> 02:15:02,250
Let me check your wound.

1241
02:15:58,791 --> 02:16:00,166
Allah!

1242
02:16:08,708 --> 02:16:09,666
Najeeb.

1243
02:16:11,375 --> 02:16:12,333
Lizard.

1244
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:14,625
Look!

1245
02:16:15,125 --> 02:16:16,083
Look, Najeeb!

1246
02:16:23,583 --> 02:16:24,500
Najeeb!

1247
02:16:25,541 --> 02:16:26,500
Najeeb!

1248
02:16:27,625 --> 02:16:28,500
Come!

1249
02:16:28,916 --> 02:16:30,166
Lizard! Water!

1250
02:16:36,916 --> 02:16:37,791
Najeeb!

1251
02:16:38,166 --> 02:16:39,041
Water!

1252
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:41,125
Where?

1253
02:16:43,625 --> 02:16:45,708
Water? Where is it?

1254
02:16:45,916 --> 02:16:47,208
Where's the water?

1255
02:16:47,458 --> 02:16:48,625
Water!

1256
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:49,708
Green!

1257
02:16:50,666 --> 02:16:51,791
Green!

1258
02:16:52,250 --> 02:16:53,208
Come!

1259
02:16:53,541 --> 02:16:55,500
Where is the water?

1260
02:16:56,541 --> 02:16:58,541
Where's the water?

1261
02:16:59,041 --> 02:17:00,375
Water…

1262
02:17:01,583 --> 02:17:02,708
Water.

1263
02:17:03,791 --> 02:17:05,041
Najeeb, water!

1264
02:17:07,083 --> 02:17:09,083
Green!
Praise the Lord!

1265
02:17:14,458 --> 02:17:15,875
Look!

1266
02:17:17,291 --> 02:17:18,375
Water!

1267
02:17:20,833 --> 02:17:24,291
Thank you, Lord Almighty.
Thank you for showing us the way.

1268
02:17:25,041 --> 02:17:26,666
Najeeb, don't run!

1269
02:17:27,791 --> 02:17:28,916
Najeeb!

1270
02:17:32,875 --> 02:17:34,041
Let go of me!

1271
02:17:35,375 --> 02:17:36,458
Najeeb!

1272
02:17:38,458 --> 02:17:39,541
Water!

1273
02:17:52,458 --> 02:17:53,625
Najeeb!

1274
02:17:57,541 --> 02:17:58,500
Najeeb!

1275
02:18:01,416 --> 02:18:02,333
Najeeb!

1276
02:18:06,083 --> 02:18:07,083
Stop!

1277
02:18:07,208 --> 02:18:08,291
Water!

1278
02:18:08,708 --> 02:18:10,416
I need water!

1279
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:12,000
-No!
-Water!

1280
02:18:12,166 --> 02:18:13,166
No!

1281
02:18:13,250 --> 02:18:15,000
-Water!
-Don't drink water.

1282
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:16,541
Not good. Not so fast.

1283
02:18:16,791 --> 02:18:18,041
-Water!
-Not good.

1284
02:18:18,125 --> 02:18:19,583
Little.

1285
02:18:20,916 --> 02:18:23,041
-Wait for me.
-I just want to drink some water.

1286
02:18:23,125 --> 02:18:26,000
I just want to drink some water
before I die.

1287
02:21:07,750 --> 02:21:08,666
Najeeb!

1288
02:21:10,833 --> 02:21:12,250
Fresh biscuit cover.

1289
02:21:15,625 --> 02:21:16,583
There are people nearby.

1290
02:21:27,125 --> 02:21:28,000
Hey, Najeeb!

1291
02:21:29,416 --> 02:21:30,291
Look!

1292
02:21:31,916 --> 02:21:32,916
Have we reached the road?

1293
02:21:33,041 --> 02:21:34,583
Tire mark! There!

1294
02:21:35,458 --> 02:21:37,125
-Road?
-Yes.

1295
02:21:37,541 --> 02:21:38,625
Road!

1296
02:21:38,916 --> 02:21:40,041
-Najeeb!
-Road!

1297
02:21:43,333 --> 02:21:44,750
-Road!
-Najeeb!

1298
02:21:45,166 --> 02:21:46,250
Easy!

1299
02:21:48,208 --> 02:21:49,250
Road…

1300
02:21:52,291 --> 02:21:53,375
Hey!

1301
02:21:58,875 --> 02:21:59,875
Road?

1302
02:22:03,416 --> 02:22:04,541
Where is it?

1303
02:23:06,208 --> 02:23:12,125
Bringer of good

1304
02:23:13,833 --> 02:23:18,500
Your words are my guiding stars

1305
02:23:21,458 --> 02:23:26,166
Without you, I'm lost
Fading into afar

1306
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:32,125
Shed some light on me
Where you are

1307
02:23:34,125 --> 02:23:40,750
Bringer of good

1308
02:23:42,041 --> 02:23:46,583
Your words are my guiding stars

1309
02:23:48,541 --> 02:23:54,541
Without you, I'm lost
Fading into afar

1310
02:23:54,875 --> 02:24:00,166
Shed some light on me
Where you are

1311
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:33,875
Ibrahim!

1312
02:26:44,125 --> 02:26:45,125
Allah!

1313
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,458
Are you crazy?

1314
02:31:04,250 --> 02:31:05,583
Causing trouble on the road!

1315
02:31:06,208 --> 02:31:08,416
Oh, my God!

1316
02:31:08,625 --> 02:31:09,833
Move away!

1317
02:31:10,375 --> 02:31:11,916
God saved me!

1318
02:31:40,250 --> 02:31:41,583
Should I drop you off somewhere?

1319
02:31:41,791 --> 02:31:44,916
Take me… with you.

1320
02:31:45,416 --> 02:31:48,083
Should I drop you off somewhere?

1321
02:31:52,291 --> 02:31:56,666
It's okay. Don't worry.

1322
02:31:56,958 --> 02:31:58,208
Get inside.

1323
02:31:58,458 --> 02:32:00,916
God will protect you.
Get in.

1324
02:32:01,625 --> 02:32:04,125
It's okay. Get inside.

1325
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,333
Slowly.

1326
02:32:22,333 --> 02:32:23,708
Don't worry.

1327
02:32:25,791 --> 02:32:27,625
The dirt is not a problem.
I'll clean it later.

1328
02:32:28,333 --> 02:32:29,458
You relax.

1329
02:32:34,416 --> 02:32:35,958
Water…

1330
02:32:42,875 --> 02:32:43,958
Water…

1331
02:32:44,083 --> 02:32:45,291
In the name of God…

1332
02:32:45,625 --> 02:32:46,791
Here, drink it.

1333
02:32:59,041 --> 02:33:01,875
Oh, God!
Please show mercy on this man.

1334
02:33:49,166 --> 02:33:50,375
Praise be to God.

1335
02:33:57,750 --> 02:33:59,333
Come on, step out.

1336
02:34:00,375 --> 02:34:01,541
Slowly.

1337
02:34:02,541 --> 02:34:03,750
Don't worry.

1338
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:05,583
Take care.

1339
02:34:05,708 --> 02:34:07,250
Yes, good.

1340
02:34:07,416 --> 02:34:08,666
Come on.

1341
02:34:08,958 --> 02:34:09,875
Come on.

1342
02:34:10,375 --> 02:34:12,916
Come on. Slowly, slowly.

1343
02:34:13,041 --> 02:34:15,083
Wait. Stand up.

1344
02:34:15,708 --> 02:34:16,791
The door.

1345
02:34:17,083 --> 02:34:18,333
Slowly.

1346
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:21,791
You will be good.

1347
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,041
You will be good.

1348
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:35,541
Goodbye.

1349
02:34:36,625 --> 02:34:38,458
God will be with you.

1350
02:34:59,958 --> 02:35:02,583
Move away from the car!

1351
02:35:29,708 --> 02:35:32,166
MALABAR HOTEL

1352
02:35:35,958 --> 02:35:38,541
Wherever people may endure
hardships in this world,

1353
02:35:38,625 --> 02:35:40,416
they finally end up with you.

1354
02:35:40,833 --> 02:35:42,208
What kind of magic is that, Guruanna?

1355
02:35:42,291 --> 02:35:45,666
That's not magic. It's God's plan.

1356
02:35:45,791 --> 02:35:47,708
He must not have seen water
for a long time.

1357
02:35:47,791 --> 02:35:49,291
Don't bathe him for too long,
or he might catch a fever.

1358
02:35:49,416 --> 02:35:50,875
Dry him off quickly.

1359
02:36:03,041 --> 02:36:04,041
Suresh!

1360
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:06,208
You don't need to give him
a stylish haircut or anything.

1361
02:36:06,833 --> 02:36:08,041
Just shave all his hair off.

1362
02:36:08,416 --> 02:36:09,625
His hair is filled with sand.

1363
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:12,458
If I shave it completely,
it will start to bleed.

1364
02:36:12,791 --> 02:36:14,083
Let him be able to hold
his head up straight first.

1365
02:36:14,666 --> 02:36:15,625
He has a fever.

1366
02:36:16,041 --> 02:36:17,500
Should we admit him to the hospital?

1367
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,166
What are you saying?

1368
02:36:19,333 --> 02:36:21,833
How do we take him out when he
doesn't have any documents with him?

1369
02:36:22,625 --> 02:36:23,875
Do you know the male nurse, Balamurgan?

1370
02:36:24,083 --> 02:36:25,458
I've asked him to come here.

1371
02:36:25,583 --> 02:36:29,208
If he gets a tetanus shot and an IV drip,
he'll be able to hold his head straight.

1372
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:31,958
We'll ask him where he's from after that.

1373
02:36:32,041 --> 02:36:33,166
-Found it!
-Wow! And then?

1374
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:35,833
-What did you think of me?
-That's good. Did you speak to them?

1375
02:36:35,916 --> 02:36:36,833
Well, of course!

1376
02:36:36,916 --> 02:36:38,375
Then provide me with the phone number.

1377
02:36:38,583 --> 02:36:40,000
Don't waste money on small talk.

1378
02:36:40,208 --> 02:36:41,583
-Write it down.
-Kumar!

1379
02:36:42,291 --> 02:36:48,208
-Note down the phone number.
-It's 04312313117.

1380
02:36:48,458 --> 02:36:50,541
It's their neighbor's house.
Call them right away.

1381
02:36:50,625 --> 02:36:51,708
They are waiting.

1382
02:36:51,833 --> 02:36:54,083
-I'll call right away. Thanks.
-Okay, brother.

1383
02:36:54,166 --> 02:36:55,125
What is it?

1384
02:36:55,333 --> 02:36:57,250
It's been a while since I last saw you
at our association meetings.

1385
02:36:57,458 --> 02:36:58,583
Where do I have the time?

1386
02:36:58,833 --> 02:37:00,416
Out-passes are ready
for a couple of people.

1387
02:37:00,583 --> 02:37:02,625
I'm seeking a sponsor
to purchase tickets for them.

1388
02:37:02,833 --> 02:37:04,125
Anyway, I have to make a call.

1389
02:37:08,125 --> 02:37:09,916
Are you always listening to music?

1390
02:37:10,125 --> 02:37:11,708
Isn't it time for your shift?
Get going!

1391
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:17,875
Your fever has gone down.

1392
02:37:18,708 --> 02:37:19,958
Sit up straight for a while.

1393
02:37:26,083 --> 02:37:28,041
I tried calling
all the phone numbers you gave me,

1394
02:37:28,875 --> 02:37:30,000
but I couldn't get through to any of them.

1395
02:37:30,291 --> 02:37:31,583
It's been three to four years, right?

1396
02:37:31,708 --> 02:37:33,166
The numbers might have changed.

1397
02:37:34,750 --> 02:37:36,541
But the address you gave me is correct.

1398
02:37:37,166 --> 02:37:38,458
I inquired there
and found your people as well.

1399
02:37:42,791 --> 02:37:44,041
Your family…

1400
02:37:44,541 --> 02:37:46,500
must be waiting for my call
at your neighbor's house now.

1401
02:37:47,166 --> 02:37:48,083
Hello?

1402
02:37:48,625 --> 02:37:50,083
-Hello?
-Yes.

1403
02:37:50,541 --> 02:37:52,375
Hello? Is this Najeeb's family?

1404
02:37:52,458 --> 02:37:53,958
Yes. I'll get her on the line.

1405
02:37:54,125 --> 02:37:55,125
I'll pass the phone to him.

1406
02:37:56,083 --> 02:37:57,041
Here you go. Talk.

1407
02:38:01,958 --> 02:38:02,833
Hello?

1408
02:38:04,541 --> 02:38:05,583
Dear?

1409
02:38:06,875 --> 02:38:08,041
Dear?

1410
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:13,000
-Dear…
-Hel…

1411
02:38:14,375 --> 02:38:16,625
I can't believe it!

1412
02:38:21,291 --> 02:38:22,791
Oh, God!

1413
02:38:24,625 --> 02:38:26,666
Where were you?

1414
02:38:29,375 --> 02:38:30,916
Dear…

1415
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:35,083
It's our son, Nabeel.

1416
02:38:47,166 --> 02:38:48,208
What's your name?

1417
02:38:50,458 --> 02:38:51,625
What's your name?

1418
02:38:52,208 --> 02:38:53,583
Tell him your name.

1419
02:38:54,333 --> 02:38:55,333
Najeeb.

1420
02:38:56,916 --> 02:38:58,416
Najeeb Mohammed.

1421
02:38:59,000 --> 02:38:59,916
India.

1422
02:39:02,125 --> 02:39:03,500
-Hindi?
-Yes. Hindi.

1423
02:39:04,708 --> 02:39:05,958
-Salih.
-Yes, sir.

1424
02:39:11,041 --> 02:39:13,125
Take his thumbprint
and record his name in the register.

1425
02:39:13,208 --> 02:39:14,083
Okay.

1426
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:16,166
Give me your hand. Here.

1427
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Come on.

1428
02:39:22,375 --> 02:39:23,291
Come.

1429
02:39:23,625 --> 02:39:25,958
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you as well.

1430
02:39:26,041 --> 02:39:28,000
-How are you?
-I'm doing good.

1431
02:39:28,125 --> 02:39:30,625
-I'm good. What is this?
-Check this.

1432
02:39:31,833 --> 02:39:33,166
Indian. Hindi.

1433
02:39:37,333 --> 02:39:39,791
He doesn't have a passport
or a residential permit.

1434
02:39:40,041 --> 02:39:41,500
Doesn't he have his own photo?

1435
02:39:41,666 --> 02:39:42,958
No, he doesn't.

1436
02:40:07,416 --> 02:40:08,375
What are you looking at?

1437
02:40:09,333 --> 02:40:10,583
Have you seen any of them?

1438
02:40:36,125 --> 02:40:37,708
In the name of God,

1439
02:40:38,041 --> 02:40:39,208
let us begin.

1440
02:40:40,125 --> 02:40:41,125
Listen carefully.

1441
02:40:41,250 --> 02:40:45,000
-Silence!
-Make way!

1442
02:40:45,083 --> 02:40:49,083
Make way! Line up! Come on!

1443
02:40:49,250 --> 02:40:52,375
-Make way!
-Come on!

1444
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:56,125
Line up so that your sponsors
can identify you properly.

1445
02:40:57,375 --> 02:41:00,041
No one should talk.
Keep silent.

1446
02:41:00,166 --> 02:41:01,666
What are they shouting?

1447
02:41:01,791 --> 02:41:04,458
-Narayana, please keep quiet.
-They've lined us up as if

1448
02:41:04,541 --> 02:41:05,666
we're goods for sale in a market.

1449
02:41:08,791 --> 02:41:10,625
Narayana, don't you know what will happen

1450
02:41:10,708 --> 02:41:12,500
if your sponsor identifies you
before the out-pass is issued?

1451
02:41:12,583 --> 02:41:13,791
You rascal! Where were you?

1452
02:41:13,875 --> 02:41:14,958
Where did you go?

1453
02:41:15,041 --> 02:41:16,958
I've been looking for you for so long!

1454
02:41:17,041 --> 02:41:18,125
Where were you?

1455
02:41:18,250 --> 02:41:19,208
Where were you?

1456
02:41:19,291 --> 02:41:21,875
Enough! Take him with you!

1457
02:41:22,041 --> 02:41:23,708
He was supposed to go
back home tomorrow.

1458
02:41:23,875 --> 02:41:27,125
-He is done for!
-I didn't do anything! Let me go!

1459
02:41:27,208 --> 02:41:29,375
-Dear Lord!
-Make way! Step aside!

1460
02:41:29,833 --> 02:41:32,041
-Go back! Line up!
-Sir, let me go…

1461
02:41:37,708 --> 02:41:41,541
Go back! Line up!

1462
02:41:41,875 --> 02:41:44,625
Go back! Step aside!

1463
02:41:45,333 --> 02:41:46,625
Go back!

1464
02:41:47,166 --> 02:41:50,583
Go back! Line up!

1465
02:42:18,666 --> 02:42:20,541
Bloody son of a gun!

1466
02:42:20,833 --> 02:42:23,833
You think you can fool me?

1467
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:30,541
-I'll show you what I can do!
-Don't take me back!

1468
02:42:30,625 --> 02:42:34,041
-I will teach you a lesson!
-Please don't take me back there!

1469
02:42:34,750 --> 02:42:36,416
-Don't--
-I'll show you what I can do!

1470
02:42:37,916 --> 02:42:39,875
I will teach you a lesson!

1471
02:42:39,958 --> 02:42:41,250
Don't hit me!

1472
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:40,291
So, you got away?

1473
02:43:41,166 --> 02:43:43,541
If you were really under my sponsorship,
I'd have hauled you back to the Masara.

1474
02:43:49,625 --> 02:43:53,125
It's so hot in here.

1475
02:43:54,041 --> 02:43:56,750
Najeeb, he was not your actual sponsor.

1476
02:43:57,208 --> 02:43:59,583
If he was, he would've dragged
you back to the Masara now.

1477
02:44:00,166 --> 02:44:02,708
Your visa was sponsored by someone else,
but this man abducted you.

1478
02:44:05,708 --> 02:44:08,125
He was working under this Arab.

1479
02:44:08,375 --> 02:44:09,583
So unfortunate.

1480
02:44:42,166 --> 02:44:46,166
ALL THE LIVES WE'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
ARE JUST TALL STORIES FOR US

1481
02:44:54,208 --> 02:44:56,750
The three months I spent in jail

1482
02:44:57,250 --> 02:45:00,416
felt longer than the three years
I spent in the desert.

1483
02:45:00,833 --> 02:45:02,916
Since I began to feel hopeful
about returning home,

1484
02:45:03,041 --> 02:45:04,708
I haven't slept at all.

1485
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,416
It was a long wait for the out-pass.

1486
02:45:07,958 --> 02:45:11,708
At the airport,
amid the crowd awaiting expats

1487
02:45:12,083 --> 02:45:16,208
with large suitcases filled with perfumes,
tape recorders, and televisions,

1488
02:45:16,625 --> 02:45:20,541
my son and Sainu will be waiting for me.

1489
02:45:20,666 --> 02:45:25,458
All that remains for me to give them
is the time I have left in my life.

1490
02:45:26,291 --> 02:45:27,583
THIS IS NOT JUST NAJEEB'S STORY.

1491
02:45:27,666 --> 02:45:30,666
IT IS THE GRIEF OF MANY THOUSANDS
WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE DESERT,

1492
02:45:30,833 --> 02:45:34,291
LEAVING THEIR COUNTRY AND HOME TO SURVIVE.
